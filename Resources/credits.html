    <p>In order to create this website, I used GitHub to hold the repository and VS Code for the Web to code the HTML.</p>
    <p>Claude AI was used to write the CSS stylesheet (I'm not very good at writing CSS and it sped this process up a lot) and also to format a lot of things that I had written before for HTML.</p>
    <p>I wrote basically everything else, including the content of the website, the podcast scripts, and the HTML code
